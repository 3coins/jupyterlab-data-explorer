# JupyterLab Data Explorer

 [![Stability Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-red.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-red.svg)

We are currently building a data registry for JupyterLab [#5548](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5548). This repository is to create a dataset explorer on top of that registry. The idea is to show users datasets that have been registered, along with:

* Render the dataset using MIME renderers.
* Comment and annotate on the dataset.
* View and edit metadata associated with the dataset.
